  <TreatyNote>
    <Text>The International Refugee Organization (IRO) was established in 1946 as a temporary specialized agency of the United Nations. In arranging for the care and the repatriation or resettlement of Europeans made homeless by World War II, the organization brought to a conclusion part of the work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. IRO was dissolved by Resolution No. 108, adopted by the General Council of the IRO at its 101st meeting on 15 February 1952. It terminated its work in 1952, having resettled circa 1,000,000 persons. It was superseded by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</Text>
